As a store owner, I want to be able to compute for the correct
discount per customer so that the dogmandu members get extra discounts.


Business Logic:
At the DogMandu Anniversary Sale shop, a discount coupon is provided
to each customer (discount can be arbitrary). The discount has an added 
5% if the customer is a dogmandu member.
However, if a coupon is expired, despite
being a member, no discount is given.
Also, items already on sale are excluded
from discounts for non members. Members however still get the
discount on these items plus the base member discount of 5%.
