// Business Logic:
At the DogMandu shop, a discount coupon is provided
to a customer. The discount has an added 
5% if the customer is a dogmandu member.
However, if a coupon is expired, despite
being a member, no discount is given.
Also, items already on sale are excluded
from discounts for non members. Members however still get the
discount on these items at 5%.

As a store owner, I want to be able to compute for the correct
discount per customer.
