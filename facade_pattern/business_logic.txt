User Story: As a customer, I want to be able to pay for my purchases in a secure way.

We are integrating a payment gateway into our site. The task for this is to implement
a way to pay securely using an SDK. 

In using the payment gateway SDK, these are the following steps:

1. IEnvironment - Set the environment. Assume step to either be SANDBOX or PRODUCTION. 
2. IMerchantAuthenticationType - Assume interface requires login id and transaction key.
3. IBillingAddress - A billing address type. Require first name, last name, address, city and zip code.
3. ICreditCard - Can be a visa, mastercard or amex credit card. Must implement typename, account number, cvc and expiry date.
4. ITransactionRequest - Requires amount in decimal, IBillingAddress and ICreditCardType supplied.
5. ITransactionController - Requires an ITransactionRequest, an Execute function and a GetApiResponse function.
    The GetApiResponse function returns either OK or Declined.
    - Decline if
        + Environment not Set
        + Merchant authentication not set.
        + ICreditCardType has expired date.
    - Otherwise, returns OK.
